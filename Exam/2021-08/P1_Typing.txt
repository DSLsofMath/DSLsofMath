P1 [25p] Typing maths: continuity and differentiability from limits
----------------
1a) [7p] Explain the typing and scoping rules for the |lim|
    construction (what can be written before and after the arrow,
    etc.).

In the notation

  lim_{e1 -> e2} e3

the expression |e1| is a variable name such that the anonymous
function |\e1 -> e3| is the one for which the limit is computed at the
point |e2|. The scope of |e1| is only |e3|, not |e2|.

(Sometimes |e1| can be a more complex pattern, such as |(x,y)| binding
two variables to the components of a pair or vector.)

In our case the type of the function is |X -> Y| for some subsets |X|
and |Y| of |REAL|. The expression |e2| should evaluate to a limit
point of |X|, thus in or "near" |X|.

----------------
1b) [6p] Give the types of |f|, |f'|, |x|, |h| in the definition of
    |f' x|.  Explain your reasoning.

We have |f : X -> Y|, |f' : X' -> REAL|, |x : X|, |h : REAL|.

The expression |(f (x+h) - f x)/h| indicates that |Y| is a subset of
|REAL| and the limit |0| for |h| indicates that |h| is also a |REAL|.
The type |X'| is different from |X| when |f| is not differentiable
everywhere. 

----------------
1c) [6p] Prove that |s| is differentiable at |x| for all |x : REAL| using
the definition above, and define a closed form for |s'|.

The expression in the limit is

  (s (x+h) - s x)/h
= {- if x+h and x are >= 0 -}
  (x^2+2*x*h+h^2 - x^2)/h
= (2*x*h+h^2)/h
= 2*x+h

thus the limit = 2*x for x>=0

Similarly, the limit = -2*x for x<0

Thus s' x = 2*abs x

----------------
1d) [6p] What is the set of all |x| such that |s'| is differentiable
at |x| and what is |s''| (the 2nd derivative of |s|)?

Here the expression in the limit is

  (s' (x+h) - s' x)/h
= {- if x+h and x are >0 -}
  (2*(x+h) - 2*x)/h
= 2

and, similarly, if x+h and x are <0,
= -2

Left to explore is the single point x=0.

  (s' (0+h) - s' 0)/h
= (2*abs h)/h
= 2*signum h

Even for h arbitrarily close to zero this expression has two different
values: +2 and -2 (depending on the sign of h).

Thus s'' x = 2*signum x for all non-zero x.
