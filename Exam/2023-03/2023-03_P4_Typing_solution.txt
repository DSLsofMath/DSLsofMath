a)
x :: REAL
S :: REAL -> Bool  -- or Pow REAL (the powerset of the real numbers)
y :: REAL
eps :: RPos -- or just REAL

Reasoning: the text explicitly says that x is a real number. When the
predicate holds, x is even in S, but not in general. S is a subset of
the reals, which can be modelled as a predicate (a function from reals
to Bool) or as an element of the powerset (the set of all subsets). As
y is compared to x with equality (and subtracted from x) it also needs
to be of the same type as x. Finally, eps is a positive real number
because abs returns a (non-negative) real number and the text requires
it to be >0.

I(S,x) = (x `elem` S) &&
          (Exists eps. (eps > 0)
            & Forall y. (abs (x - y) < eps) => (not (y `elem` S) || (x == y)))

A(S,x) = (x `elem` S) &&
          (Forall eps. (eps > 0) =>
            Exists y. (abs (x - y) < eps) && (y `elem` S) && (x /= y))

Part 1: Show I(S,1)

To show I(S,1), we first have to show 1 is in S.
  We have 1 = 1/1 with 1 a positive natural number, so 1 is in S.

Then we have to find an eps > 0 with a certain property.
  We can take eps = 1/2.
  To show 1/2 has the desired property, suppose given y such that
  abs (1 - y) < 1/2.
  We need to show that either y is not a member of S, or y = 1.
  If y = 1, we are done, so suppose not.
  We claim y is not a member of S.
  [Start of proof of negation]
  Suppose y were a member of S, i.e. y = 1/n with n > 0 a natural number,
  or y = 0. We cannot have y = 0, since |1 - 0| = 1 is not less than 1/2,
  so we may suppose y is of the form 1/n.
  Since we supposed y is not 1, n is not 1. Thus n is at least 2.
  This means 1/n <= 1/2.
  So abs (1 - y)  >=  1 - y  >=  1 - 1/2  =  1/2.
  This contradicts the assumption abs (1 - y) < 1/2, so we are done.
  [End of proof of negation]
Thus we have found an eps we the desired property.

Part 2: Show A(S,0)

To show A(s,0), we first have to show 0 is in S. Indeed 0 is in {0} so
  it is in S.

Next, suppose given eps > 0. We have to produce a y with |0 - y| < eps
  and y different from 0 and y in S.
  Since eps > 0, 1 / eps is a real number.
  Take N large enough that N > 1 / eps.
  Let y = 1/N.
  Now abs (0 - y) = abs (-1/N) = 1/N < eps since N > 1/eps.
  y is different from 0 since it is positive.
  y is in S since it is of the form 1/n.
This finishes the proof.

d)
Let S be a subset of the reals, and x an element of S. We compute

    not I(S,x)
<=> (by definition)
    not ((x `elem` S) &&
      (Exists eps. (eps > 0)
        && Forall y. (abs (x - y) < eps) => (not (y `elem` S) || (x == y))))
<=> (using de Morgan's law)
    not (x `elem` S) ||
        not (Exists eps. (eps > 0)
            && Forall y. (abs (x - y) < eps) => (not (y `elem` S) || (x == y)))
<=> (the first clause is impossible as x is an element of S)
    not (Exists eps. (eps > 0)
        && Forall y. (abs (x - y) < eps) => (not (y `elem` S) || (x == y)))
<=> (using de Morgan)
    Forall eps. not ((eps > 0)
        && Forall y. (abs (x - y) < eps) => (not (y `elem` S) || (x == y)))
<=> (using (not (P && Q)) <=> (P => not Q))
    Forall eps. (eps > 0) =>
        && not (Forall y. (abs (x - y) < eps) => (not (y `elem` S) || (x == y)))
<=> (using de Morgan)
    Forall eps. (eps > 0) =>
        && Exists y. not ((abs (x - y) < eps) => (not (y `elem` S) || (x == y)))
<=> (using (not (P => Q)) <=> (P && not Q), as well as de Morgan)
    Forall eps. (eps > 0) =>
        && Exists y. (abs (x - y) < eps) && (y `elem` S) && not (x == y)

This is how A(S,x) was defined, except for the part about x being an
element of S, which is irrelevant since we assume x `elem` S.
