# Mid-course evaluation meeting

2018-02-02, at 13.00 in room 5128: the teaching team meets the student
representatives.

## Changes from last year

The main changes for 2018 (based on the [course eval meeting](eval/2017-04-28.md)) are

* New course literature (lecture notes covering the full course)
* More material on functional programming in Haskell
* Developed more exercises to solve (primarily easier exercises to start each week with)
* More solving of exercises at the whiteboard
* Schedule changes (alternating L, E, L, E instead of L, L, E, E)
* Weekly hand-ins to encourage students to spend more hours on the course (not part of the formal examination)

One of the student evaluators from 2017 (DaHe) was hired part time to help out with these improvements.

## Input from the course representatives

Difficult to know what do in the exercises + assignments. More clear
instructions wanted. [Clarification of the actual text in the
Ex. sections of the lectures.]

Assignments: how should different ways of solving the problem be
"graded" or rated.

Unclear expectations of the "presentation slots".

Good with all the online resources.

Good with the lecture case studies and going from specific cases to
the general cases.

Good with more basic exercises. When you get stuck you can go back to
easier exercises.

Good with accumulation of solutions of exercises. [They are by design not in the lecture notes to avoid temptation.]

Would be good with more recipes = solution strategies.

Patrik: I will try to extract some from the solutions. Some are already in the notes (like the "wishful thinking" principle for implementing |eval|).

Like the idea of weekly hand-ins. 1–2 ex. to solve. Perhaps using a bonus system.

DONE: Patrik - check the course plan: too late to change the rules this year.

DONE: Perhaps use a peer-review system already this year: there is now a peer-review system in place using GitHub classroom.

# 2017-04-28: Final course evaluation meeting

Rooom: Diana, Fysikhuset

Time: 13:15 – 14:00



# 2017-02-06: Mid-course evaluation meeting

Present:
* Examiner and lecturer: P. Jansson
* Student representatives:
    * Daniel Heurlin, Oskar Vigren, Ari von Nordenskjöld

Could not attend:
* TAs: Frederik + Daniel
* ? Simon + Andreas ?

## Examination overview (as of 2017-02-06 morning):

Assignment 1 groups:
* 1 accept
* 10 minor reject
* 4 reject

## Input from the course representatives

Difficult weekly exercises: hard to get started. Please add more
information and more easy exercises.

Exercise sessions very good: friendly atmosphere, plenty of
opportunity to get questions answered, good TAs.

More lecture notes wanted. (Note that most are available in the 2016/
subdirectory.)

More specific litterature pointer wanted (for other complementing
material) for particular concepts (from lectures and exercises).

Assignment 1: more clarification of concepts wanted (definition of
|Elem|, more explanations).

Wed. lab room is suboptimal: only Windows computers, no Haskell
installed, cramped.

Done[PaJa]: Rebook the Wed. comp. room from Cal.Week 7 (= study week 5). Will be ES53 on Wed. from now on.

Long term (for 2018): perhaps add a third hand-in assignment to make
sure students work more continuously.

## For reference: Results 2016

Exam results:

| Grade    | Percentage | # students |
| --------:| ----------:| ----------:|
|  5 (VG)  |        24% |          6 |
|  4 (G)   |        24% |          6 |
|  3 (G)   |        20% |          5 |
|  U (U)   |        32% |          8 |
| Total    |       100% |         25 |

There was one 100pts thesis (impressive!), and there was one with 0pts
(just one line of text). The median is 53pts and the average
is 55.5pts.

Assignments:

| Grade    | Percentage | # students |
| --------:| ----------:| ----------:|
| 5  (VG)  |       36%  |         10 |
| 4  (G)   |       50%  |         14 |
| 3  (G)   |       11%  |          3 |
| U  (U)   |        4%  |          1 |
| Total    |      100%  |         28 |

The assignments will be on a Pass/Fail grade scale from 2017.

## Changes from the 2016 course instance

In 2016 the course was taught for the very first time, and by a
different teaching team (Cezar Ionescu, Irene Lobo Valbuena). The main
changes for 2017 are

* Re-worked the first four lectures (less logic, more Haskell)
* Re-ordering of lectures
* Replacing two guest lectures by new lectures on Linear Algebra

This was based on input from the 2016 course evaluation meeting:

    > Önskade förändringar (Desired changes)
    > * Ha introduktion till Haskell i början av kursen
    > * Ha mer exempel av linjär algebra
    > * Ha föreläsningars anteckningar innan föreläsningar
