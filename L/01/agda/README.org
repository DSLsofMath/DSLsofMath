This subdirectory is not part of the learning outcomes of the
DSLsofMath course 2022 - it is included just as extra material for
those interested in Agda.

It has two versions of the same program:
  file:TypeDSL.agda
is almost self-contained while
  file:TypeDSL2.agda
tries to blend in more with the agda "standard library".

There is a live coding video on YouTube where Patrik Jansson
implements file:TypeDSL.agda:

Here are some exercises starting from this:
+ Implement a constructor |Pow| for which |card (Pow a b) = (card a) ^ (card b)| and |typ (Pow a b) = typ b -> typ a|.
+ Implement decidable equality.
