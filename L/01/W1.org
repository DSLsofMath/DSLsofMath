** Examination
+ *Written Exam*         -> grade U/3/4/5
+ *2 Assignments (labs)* -> Pass/fail grade
+ Weekly exercises       -> Bonus points for the exam
** Weekly exercises (-> bonus points for the exam)
+ [[https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/33098/assignments/101421][Week 1 bonus]]
  Choose any two from
  Exc. 1.3 (Counting values),
       1.4 (Counting Maybes),
       1.8 (Composing sequences),
       1.12 (Polar complex)
+ See Chapter 1 in the book and *ask questions* if anything is unclear.
+ Make sure to *read the chapter* as well.
** Reminder about spending time on the course:
+ Advice from last years' students:
  spending time on the course pays off.
  It is not enough to just focus on the labs.
+ Patrik's advice: read the book, solve exercises: Ch. N = Week N

** Learning outcomes (for the whole course, english version)
*** KU = Knowledge and Understanding
+ KU.DSL      = design and implement a DSL for a new domain
+ KU.Org      = organize areas of mathematics in DSL terms
+ KU.Explain  = explain main concepts of elementary real and complex analysis, algebra, and linear algebra
*** SA = Skills and Abilities
+ SA.Notation = develop adequate notation for mathematical concepts
+ SA.Calc     = perform calculational proofs
+ SA.Power    = use power series for solving differential equations
+ SA.Laplace  = use Laplace transforms for solving differential equations
*** JA = Judgement and Approach
+ JA = discuss and compare different software implementations of mathematical concepts
** Other info
+ DSLM Teaching team will come by at 14.50 to say hi.
+ Please fill in "Studentbarometern" (see school mail for individual link).
* L1.1 learning outcomes:
** What is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL)
A DSL has four components:
+ Surface syntax (mostly ignored in this course): a set of strings defined by a grammar
+ Abstract syntax: usually a recursive Haskell datatype of syntax trees
+ Semantic type: a type of values (meanings) for the syntax
+ Semantics: a function from eval : AbsSyn -> Sem
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language
** Variable scope and binding in mathematical expressions [integral, fun.def.]
** Haskell interpreter use and interp. of error messages ([[file:Live1_2025.lhs][interactive live coding]])
** Syntax trees
+ datatype of syntax trees of simple arith. expr.
** First evaluator: |eval :: E -> Int|
* E1.1 learning outcomes:
** a Haskell environment up and running
** syntax trees with constructor for variables
** definition and use of |Env|
** laws, properties, and testing
* End of Tuesday


























* L1.2 Intro / admin
** Student communication: [[https://dslsofmath2025.slack.com/][Slack discussion forum]]
** Exercise sessions: be prepared with questions
   2h*2 lectures = 4h/w
   2h*2 exercise sessions = 4h/w
   total 8h/w "scheduled"
   But, 7.5hp = 200h spread over 8 study weeks -> 200/8 = 25h/week "study time"
   Thus 17h/week left for you to schedule your own work with the course.
** *Read the book!* Chapter N = study week N
+ Not all sections are covered in lectures
+ Some sections not included in the course (marked with a "*")

* L1.2 learning outcomes:
** Expanding a number system [N -> Z -> Q -> REAL -> Complex]
+ When equations meet types - more and more eq. can be solved.
** Active reading of mathematical text [[[file:Live2_2025.lhs][Complex number case study]]]
** Modelling (different versions of) Complex in Haskell
** |eval :: Syntax -> Semantics| for complex number expressions
** The DSL of types in Haskell:
*** |type|, |newtype|, |data|
*** types and their constructors
*** |data|: choice, recursion, parameters
*** datatype of syntax trees of simple arith. expr.
*** |Nat|, |ImagUnits|, |CA|, |CB|, |CE|
** Syntax and semantics
