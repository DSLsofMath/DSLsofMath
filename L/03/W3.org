* Week & chapter 3: Types in mathematics

Learning outcomes

** Knowledge and understanding
+ L3.1: organize areas of mathematics in DSL terms
+ L3.1: explain main concepts of elementary real analysis
+ L3: design and implement a DSL for derivatives

** Skills and abilities
+ L3.1: develop adequate notation for mathematical concepts
+ L3.2: perform calculational proofs

** Judgement and approach
+ A1: discuss and compare different software implementations of mathematical concepts

* Tuesday (L3.1)
+ A1 submission deadline today (23.59).
+ Presentation slot / Q&A on Monday (2024-02-05).
** Week 3, Lecture 1: [[file:LimFun_slides.lhs][LimFun_slides.lhs]] + work on the blackboard
+ limit of a function (math text -> logic, scoping, lim)
+ types for some examples, most importantly D : (X->Y) -> (X->Y)
+ using lim to define |D|
+ some derivatives from the definition (intro to calculational proofs
  through equational reasoning)

  D (^2) = (2*)
  D (f+g) = D f + D g

+ If there is time: [[file:Live_3_1_2024.lhs][Live coding derivatives]]

* Thursday (L3.2)
** Week 3, Lecture 2, "slides" ([[https://jamboard.google.com/d/1jXX4nrptIAQu0NTi8YPF5ADuy8CyagBPHMx9vyz3_dI/viewer][Jamboard L3.2]])
+ §3.2: Partial derivatives: practice analysing mathematical text again
 [[./Book_Partial_p83.png]] 
  + Get to def. of D1 : (R²->R)->(R²->R) using
    psi1 f (x,y) h = (f(x+h,y)-f(x,y))/h
  + mention "matching by name" versus "matching by position/index"    
+ 3.3: [[file:LagrangeEqs.pdf][Lagrange Eq's]]
+ (If time permits: Lagrange example - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIxpj1H-wN8&list=PLf5C73P7ab-5sdvsqCjnF8iaYOtXMRNaZ&index=25&t=1311s][available on YouTube from earlier years]].)
  L : T x Q x V -> R
  L ( t , x , v) = -m*g*x + m*v²/2
** Week 3, Lecture 2 [[file:Live_3_2_2024.lhs][Live coding]]
+ finish implementation of deriv : FunExp -> FunExp
+ Type classes
+ numeric instances for functions (x->a)

  Numeric classes in more detail

  function instances for numeric classes

  General type classes in Haskell
