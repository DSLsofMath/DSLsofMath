* Week & chapter 3: Types in mathematics

Learning outcomes

** Knowledge and understanding
+ L3.1: organize areas of mathematics in DSL terms
+ L3.1: explain main concepts of elementary real analysis
+ L3: design and implement a DSL for derivatives

** Skills and abilities
+ L3.1: develop adequate notation for mathematical concepts
+ L3.2: perform calculational proofs

** Judgement and approach
+ A1: discuss and compare different software implementations of mathematical concepts

* Week 3, Lecture 1: [[https://jamboard.google.com/d/1sqDpuri01uQkep0tA9g_AgRfMMHwTceI8iVTNTfEuo4/edit?usp=sharing][Jamboard L3.1]]
+ limit of a function (math text -> logic, scoping, lim)
+ types for some examples, most importantly D : (X->Y) -> (X->Y)
+ using lim to define |D|
+ some derivatives from the definition
+ [[file:Live_3_1.lhs][Live coding derivatives]]

* Week 3, Lecture 2, admin
** A1 = Assignment 1: good work!
+ hand-in was on Tuesday,
+ Q&A session on Monday ("oral examination")
  Main goal: ensure that all lab group participants have been active
  and understand the submitted solution.
+ Schedule: each group has one slot
+ There will be one Zoom meeting ongoing, with a waiting room. Please
  connect 5min before your slot and make sure all your group members
  are also ready.
+ We reuse the "Exercise session" Zoom link [link and password in canvas].
** Mid-course evaluation meeting
+ Meeting held 2022-02-03
*** Course actions based on student feedback (already earlier)
+ Course "homepage" changed from Course-memo to Lecture media
+ Added [[file:../README.org][L/README.org]] mapping lectures to book sections  -- read Chapter N for study week N
+ Lecture media uploaded after each lecture
+ Some book typos fixed through pull requests [Thanks!]
*** How to read the book
+ Work with the material - on paper or with Haskell
+ The code of all chapters is (now) in separate files in the repo
*** Zoom-meeting video lag
+ It turns out zoom gives me only 1 (one!) fps (frame per second) when
  screen-sharing. [And 3-5 seconds lag when typing. Terrible. Sorry.]
+ Experiments underway to improve this [feedback appreciated].
*** More active exercise sessions
+ Many students have questions, but too few questions reach the teaching team.
+ The "post your zoom link on canvas" mode is not working well enough.
+ We will try to use the lecture zoom link + breakout rooms instead.

* Week 3, Lecture 2, "slides" ([[https://jamboard.google.com/d/1jXX4nrptIAQu0NTi8YPF5ADuy8CyagBPHMx9vyz3_dI/viewer][Jamboard L3.2]])
+ Partial derivatives
+ Lagrange Eq's
+ Lagrange example
* Week 3, Lecture 2, [[file:Live_3_2.lhs][Live coding]]
+ Type classes
* Week 3, Lecture 3, cont.  [[file:Live_3_3.lhs][Live coding]]
+ finish implementation of deriv : FunExp -> FunExp
+ numeric instances for functions (x->a)

  Numeric classes in more detail

  function instances for numeric classes

  General type classes in Haskell [see code below]
