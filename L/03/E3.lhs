\begin{exercise}\label{exc:Lagrange}
  To get a feeling for the \addtoindex{Lagrange equations}, let us
  take the case of an object falling in constant gravity:
  %
  |L(t, q, v) = m*v^2/2 - m*g*q|, compute |expand w|, perform the
  derivatives and check if the equation is satisfied for the following
  three cases.
  %
  If, in one of the cases, the equation is not satisfied in general,
  see if you can find some values of the mass |m| and the acceleration
  due to gravity |g| which make the equations hold.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item |w1 = id| or
  \item |w2 = sin| or
  \item |w3 = (q0-).(g*).(/2).(powTo 2)|
%TODO: check
  \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}
% \begin{exercise}
%TODO: perhaps add a few more Lagrange equation examples: pendulum, double pendulum, several particles in a gravitational field, etc.
% See blackboard/W3/20170130_154754.jpg
% \end{exercise}

%TODO (DaHe): Exercise introducing deep vs shallow embedding using type classes
% also, maybe introduce the concept of using type classes to return a deep
% embedding by using the operators of the data type, and casting to the
% syntactic type
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
% IDEA: Use the card/hand datatypes from the blackjack haskell lab, and
% implement a deep and shallow embedding for hands (the shallow one just returns
% the sum of the cards, based on some score :: Card -> Iteger). Then show that
% when we introduce a new rule into the game, where the combination (syntax) of
% the cards in hand matters, the shallow embedding is not enough.
%
% This is the data type I have in mind:
%
% data Card = Card {rank :: Rank, suit :: Suit}
%             deriving(Eq, Show)

% data Suit = Hearts | Spades | Diamonds | Clubs
%     deriving(Eq, Show)

% data Rank = Numeric Integer | Jack | Queen | King | Ace
%     deriving(Eq, Show)

% data Hand = Empty | Add Card Hand
%     deriving(Eq, Show)
%
% I believe this is given (at least it was during my year) at the start of a
% lab, so it shouldn't spoil any solution. Alternatively, we could just use
% a different but similar data type.
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


%TODO (DaHe): Exercise asking to implement a deep and a shallow embedding of some data
% type, using knowlege acquired from above

%TODO (DaHe): Describe a thing, ask to implement DSL for that thing by introducing
% data type, deep shallow embedding, evaluator


%TODO (DaHe): One or two exercieses presenting the definition of a
% mathematical concept / equation, and then ask student to type the variables and
% expressions involved. Should be split into parts, similar to exam questions.
% (This should probably come first)

\begin{exercise}
  \fromExam{2016-Practice}

  Consider the following text from
  \citeauthor{maclane1986mathematics}'s
  \textit{Mathematics Form and Function}
%\citetitle{maclane1986mathematics} %requires biblatex https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/5091/what-to-do-to-switch-to-biblatex
%\textit{Mathematics: Form and Function}
(page 168):

  \begin{quote}
    If $z = g(y)$ and $y = h(x)$ are two functions with continuous
    derivatives, then in the relevant range $z = g(h(x))$ is a
    function of $x$ and has derivative
%
    \[z'(x) = g'(y) * h'(x)\]
  \end{quote}

  Give the types of the elements involved (|x|, |y|, |z|, |g|, |h|,
  |z'|, |g'|, |h'|, |*| and \('\)).
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  \fromExam{2016-03-16}

    Consider the following text from
    \citeauthor{maclane1986mathematics}'s \textit{Mathematics Form
    and Function} (page 182):

   \begin{quote}
     In these cases one tries to find not the values of \(x\) which
     make a given function \(y = f(x)\) a minimum, but the values of a given
     function \(f(x)\) which make a given quantity a minimum.  Typically,
     that quantity is usually measured by an integral whose integrand is
     some expression \(F\) involving both \(x\), values of the function \(y =
     f(x)\) at interest and the values of its derivatives -- say an
     integral
%
     \[∫_a^b F(y, y', x)dx,\quad y = f(x).\]
   \end{quote}

   Give the types of the variables involved (|x|, |y|, |y'|, |f|, |F|,
   |a|, |b|) and the type of the four-argument integration operator:
%
    \[∫_.^. \cdot d\cdot\]

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:prob-notation-naive}
  \fromExam{2016-08-23}

  In the case of the simplest probability theory, we start with a
  \textit{finite}, non-empty set $\Omega$ of \textit{elementary
    events}.
  %
  An \textit{event} is a subset of $\Omega$, i.e.\ an element of the
  powerset of $\Omega$, (that is, $\mathcal{P}\,\Omega$).
  %
  A \textit{probability function} |P| associates to each event a real
  number between 0 and 1, such that

  \begin{itemize}

  \item |P| |∅ = 0|, |P| $\Omega = 1$

  \item |A| and |B| are disjoint (i.e., |A ∩ B = ∅|), then: |P A + P B
    = P (A ∪ B)|.
  \end{itemize}

  \cref{ch:probability-theory} presents more material about
  probability theory, but that material is not needed for the present
  exercise.
  
  Conditional probabilities are defined as follows
  \citep{stirzaker_2003}:

  \begin{quote}
    Let |A| and |B| be events with |P B > 0|.  Given that |B| occurs,
    the \textit{conditional probability} that |A| occurs is denoted by
    |P(A||B)| and defined by
%
    |P(A||B) = P(A ∩ B) / P B|
  \end{quote}

  \begin{enumerate}

  \item What are the types of the elements involved in the definition
    of conditional probability? \\ (|P|, |∩|, |/|, $\vert$)

  \item In the 1933 monograph that set the foundations of contemporary
    probability theory, Kolmogorov used, instead of |P(A||B)|, the
    expression $P_B\, A$.
    %
    Type this expression.
    %
    Which notation do you prefer (provide a \textit{brief}
    explanation).

\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

% \begin{exercise}
%   \fromExam{2017-03} (Note that this exam question is now
%   included as an example in this chapter, see
%   \cref{sec:typePartialDerivative}.
% %
%   It is kept here in case you want to check if you remember it!
% In fact it's now commented out for this reason.
% )

% Consider the following text from page 169 of Mac Lane [1968]: %\cite{maclane1986mathematics}:

% \begin{quote}
%   [...] a function |z = f (x, y)| for all points |(x, y)| in some open
%   set |U| of the Cartesian |(x, y)|-plane.
% %
%   [...] If one holds |y| fixed, the quantity |z| remains just a
%   function of |x|; its derivative, when it exists, is called the
%   \emph{partial derivative} with respect to |x|.
% %
%   Thus at a point |(x, y)| in |U| this derivative for |h ≠ 0| is
% %
% \[
% ∂ z / ∂ x  =  f'_{x} (x, y) =
%               \lim_{h \to 0} (f (x + h, y) - f (x, y)) / h
% \]
% \end{quote}

% What are the types of the elements involved in the equation on the
% last line?
% % (\(∂ z / ∂ x\), \(f'_{x}\), \((x,y)\),\(\lim\), \ldots)
% %
% You are welcome to introduce functions and names to explain your reasoning.
% \end{exercise}

%TODO (by DaHe) This has to do with matrices, which have not been covered yet
% in W3, so should this exercise be here or later?. It doesn't actually seem to
% use any of the matrix DSL, so I think it should be solvable at this point
\begin{exercise}
\fromExam{2017-08-22}
%
\index{matrix}%
%
Multiplication for matrices (from the matrix algebra DSL).

Consider the following definition, from ``Linear Algebra'' by Donald
H. Pelletier:

\textbf{Definition:} If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix and $B$ is an
$n \times p$ matrix, then the \emph{product}, $AB$, is an $m \times p$
matrix; the $(i, j)^{th}$ entry of $AB$ is the sum of the products of
the pairs that are obtained when the entries from the $i^{th}$ row of
the left factor, $A$, are paired with those from the $j^{th}$ column
of the right factor, $B$.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduce precise types for the variables involved: $A$, $m$,
  $n$, $B$, $p$, $i$, $j$. You can write |Fin n| for the type of the
  values |{0, 1, ..., n-1}|.
\item Introduce types for the functions |mul| and |proj| where $AB$ =
  |mul A B| and |proj i j M| = ``take the $(i, j)^{th}$ entry of
  $M$''. What class constraints (if any) are needed on the type of the
  matrix entries in the two cases?
\item Implement |mul| in Haskell. You may use the functions |row| and
  |col| specified by |row i M| = ``the $i^{th}$ row of $M$'' and |col
  j M| = ``the $j^{th}$ column of $M$''. You don't need to implement
  them and here you can assume they return plain Haskell lists.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

% TODO: Make this an exercise
% The Exercise
% Read the first few paragraphs of the "Overview" section on Hamiltonian Mechanics on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics#Overview (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.) and try to explain what is going in the equation which describes the "time evolution of the system" by giving types to all elements and introducing necessary rewrites to clarify the meaning of the equation.

\begin{exercise}\label{exc:Hamiltonian}
  (\extraMaterial Extra material outside the course.)
  %
  In the same direction as the Lagrangian case study in
  \refSec{sec:Lagrangian} there are two nice blog posts by Justin Le
  about Hamiltonian dynamics implemented in Haskell: one
  \href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/introducing-the-hamilton-library.html}{introductory}
  and one
  \href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/hamiltonian-dynamics-in-haskell.html}{more
    advanced}.
  %
  It is a good exercise to work through the examples in these posts.
\end{exercise}
