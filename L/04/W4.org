** Soon back to campus teaching
+ The Swedish Government has decided to remove most pandemic
  restrictions by 2022-02-09.
+ The universities will soon communicate more details about the
  "return to campus".
+ Details coming during the week.
** more Q&A time
+ Based on feedback from the student representatives during the
  mid-course evaluation meeting we have decided to increase the
  available time for "Q&A" by converting most lecture slots into
  opportunities to ask questions and get answers from the lecturer.
+ [Exceptions: Week 7 where Nicola Botta will give the lectures and
  Week 8 when the lecturer is on vacation.]
+ Concretely, the Tuesday lecture will be a "Q&A session" on the
  regular zoom link.
+ But soon, perhaps already from Thursday, the "Q&A session" will be
  on campus in the rooms according to TimeEdit.
** video lectures remain, but will be pre-recorded.
+ The lectures will instead be uploaded before the "lecture slots" in
  the schedule and you are expected to watch them before coming to the
  Q&A.
+ Concretely this means that lecture 4.1 is already on YouTube and you
  are expected to *watch it before Tuesday 13.15* to make the most of
  the Q&A session. 
+ Similarly, for future coming "lecture slots" you are expected to
  watch the video before coming.
** A2 info (new groups coming)
+ The second Assignment will be done in *different groups* compared to
  the first assignment.
+ More information will follow during the week.
