*DSLs of Mathematics, Week 2*
* Admin:
** Student barometer
+ Please share your experience
+ [[file:Info Studentbarometer 2026 eng.pptx][info slides]]
** Bonus exercises:
+ Good work on Week 1: 10 submissions (>50% of course participants).
+ Hand-in is online (via canvas) before the exercise session
+ Then be ready (in person) to present/answer questions about your
  submission (in a separate room, with one TA). Basically a short
  one-to-one tutoring session.
** Extra Haskell lectures online [recommended watching]
+ Three YouTube videos about Haskell and "type driven development" are
  online covering: polymorphic functions, product types |(a,b)| and
  sum types |Either a b|.
** Course book <-> lecture video translation table available
+ From the 2022 instance: a file describing which parts of the
  lectures are connected to which parts of the book.
+ [[https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath/blob/master/L/README.org][github]]: [[file:../README.org][DSLsofMath/L/README.org]]
+ tldr; study week N = book chapter N.
** [[https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/38137/assignments/120178][Assignment 1]]: (deadline *2026-02-03*)
+ Deadline for hand-in, and for book a "slot" in in 7 days.
+ Then, Monday 2026-02-09: "Presentation" (Q&A) slots [20min per group]
* Lecture 2.1
** DSL for Prop = Propositional Calculus (Satslogik)
+ syntax examples
+ (truth tables)
  type Table = Namn -> Bool
+ eval : Prop -> Table -> Bool
** Start of FOL = First Order Logic
+ adding a term language (for rationals, or sets, or ...)
+ extend names to n-ary predicates over terms
** DSL for Pure set theory (useful for [[https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/38137/assignments/120178][Assignment 1]])
+ "untyped sets", "just sets all the way down"
+ Empty set, Singleton set constructor, {braces around enumeration}
+ Cardinality (number of elements)
+ Membership: x ∈ S
+ Union, Intersection - connection to logic through membership
+ Enumerating some sets (to get thinking started)
** [[file:Live_2_1.lhs][Live coding (Prop)]] [if there is time]
+ eval for Prop without variable names
+ add table for name lookup
+ generalise: polymorphic lifting functions


















* Lecture 2.2: First order logic (FOL) (as a new DSL, extending Prop)
** Motivating examples of what Patrik is doing when not teaching
+ Grant application submitted yesterday: "Trustable and Adaptable
  Software for Multi-Objective Decision Making under Uncertainty"
+ Research paper in preparation: Optimization under uncertainty
  [[http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18561][arXiv:2503.18561]] with examples of FOL formulas.
** FOL = First Order Logic
+ [[file:Live_2_2_2026.lhs][Live coding]] (syntax and semantics of FOL, based on §2.2 in the book)
+ Haskell: parametererised types:
  + data Term v: FOL terms over variables of type v
  + data FOL p v: FOL formulas with predicate symbols of type p and
    terms of type Term v
** Quantification
+ Using Forall and Exists quantifiers
+ negation of quantifiers
+ "typed quantifiers"
+ negation of typed quantifiers
** Model-finding intro
+ Simple examples of FOL formulas and possible models
+ Writing good specifications in logic is something of an art.
** "Functional interpetation" of types and proofs
+ Brief mention of Curry-Howard with an example of an "epsilon-delta"
  proof.
* Lecture 2.3: Extra lecture on Proof terms [see YouTube]
+ building proof terms (Tru, Fals, And, Or, Impl (->))
+ From Live_2_3.lhs to Live_2_3_2022.lhs
