\index{DSL!first order logic}%
\index{DSL!predicate logic}%
%
Our next DSL is that of \emph{First Order
  Logic\lnOnly{\footnote{Swedish: Första ordningens logik =
      predikatlogik}}}, or FOL for short, and also known as Predicate
Logic.
%
Compared to propositional logic, the main addition is
\emph{quantification over individuals}.
%
Additionally, one adds a language of terms --- its semantic domain
being the individuals which we quantify over.

Let us study terms first.
%
A \emph{term} is either a (term) \emph{variable} (like |x|, |y|, |z|),
or the application of a \emph{function symbol} (like |f|, |g|) to a
suitable number of terms.
%
If we have the function symbols |f| of arity |2| and |g| of arity |3|
we can form terms like \(f(x,x)\), \(g(y,z,z)\), \(g(x,y,f(x,y))\), etc.
%
The individuals are often limited to a single domain.
%
For example here we will take individuals to be rationals (to be able
to express basic mathematical concepts).
%
Consequently, the actual function symbols are also domain-specific ---
for rationals we will have addition, division, etc.
%
In this case we can model the terms as a datatype:

\begin{code}
type VarT = String
data RatT = RV VarT | FromI Integer | RPlus RatT RatT | RDiv RatT RatT
  deriving Show
\end{code}
%
The above introduces variables (with the constructor |RV|)
and three function symbols:
%
|FromI| of arity |1|, |RPlus|, |RDiv| of arity |2|.
\begin{exercise}
  Following the usual pattern, write the evaluator for |RatT|:
\begin{code}
evalRat :: RatT -> (VarT -> RatSem) -> RatSem
type RatSem = Rational
\end{code}
%
%if False
\begin{code}
evalRat = error "evalRat: todo"
\end{code}
%endif
%
\end{exercise}
%
As mentioned above, the propositions (often referred to as
\emph{formulas} in the context of FOL) are extended so that they can
refer to terms.
%
That is, the names from the propositional calculus are generalised to
\emph{predicate symbols} of different arity.
%
The predicate symbols can only be applied to terms, not to other
predicate symbols or formulas.
%
As an arbitrary example, if we have the predicate symbols |Positive| of
arity |1| and |LessThan| of arity |2| we can form \emph{formulas} like
|Positive#(x)|, |LessThan#(f#(x,x),y)|, etc.
%
Note that we have two separate layers, with terms at the bottom:
%
formulas normally refer to terms, but terms cannot refer to formulas.


The formulas introduced so far are all \emph{atomic formulas}:
generalisations of the \emph{names} from |Prop|.
%
Now we will add two more concepts:
%
first the logical connectives from the propositional calculus:
%
|And|, |Or|, |Implies|, |Not|, and then two quantifiers:
%
``forall'' (|ForallAlone|) and ``exists'' (|ExistsAlone|).
%
Thus the following are examples of FOL formulas:
%
\begin{spec}
  Forall x (Positive#(x) => (Exists y (LessThan#(f#(x,x),y))))
  Forall x (Forall y (Equal#(plus#(x,y),plus#(y,x))))            -- |plus| is commutative
\end{spec}
%
Here is the second formula again, but with infix operators:
%
\begin{spec}
  Forall x (Forall y ((x+y)==(y+x)))
\end{spec}
%
Note that |(==)| is a binary predicate symbol (written |Equal| above),
while |(+)| is a binary function symbol (written |plus| above).



%
The fact that quantification is over individuals is a defining
characteristic of FOL.  If one were to, say, quantify over predicates,
we would have a higher-order logic, with completely different properties.
%



As before we can model the expression syntax (for FOL, in this case)
as a datatype.
%
We keep on using the logical connectives |Implies|, |And|, |Or|, |Not| from the
type |Prop|, add predicates over terms, and quantification.
%
The constructor |Equal| could be eliminated in favour of |PName "Equal"| but
it is often included as a separate constructor.

\begin{code}
type PSym = String
data FOL  =  Implies FOL FOL | And FOL FOL | Or FOL FOL | Not FOL
          |  FORALL  VarT  FOL    |  EXISTS  VarT  FOL
          |  PName PSym [RatT]    |  Equal  RatT  RatT
  deriving Show
\end{code}

\subsection{Evaluator for Formulas and \extraMaterial Undecidability}

Setting us up for failure, let us attempt to write an |eval| function
for FOL, as we did for propositional logic.

In propositional logic, we allowed the interpretation of propositional
variables to change depending on the environment.
%
Here, we will let the interpretation of term variables be dependent on
an environment, which will therefore map (term) variables to
individuals (|VarT -> RatSem|).
%
If we so wished, we could have an environment for the interpretation
of predicate names, with an environment of type |PSym -> [RatSem] ->
Bool|.
%
Rather, with little loss of generality, we will fix this
interpretation, via a constant function |eval0|, which may look like
this:
%
\begin{code}
eval0 :: PSym -> [RatSem] -> Bool
eval0 "Equal"     [t1,t2]  =  t1 == t2
eval0 "LessThan"  [t1,t2]  =  t1 < t2
eval0 "Positive"  [t1]     =  t1 > 0
\end{code}
%
So we would use the following type, and go our merry way for most cases:
\begin{code}
eval :: FOL -> (VarT -> RatSem) -> Bool
eval formula env = ev formula
  where  ev (PName n args)  = eval0 n (map (flip evalRat env) args)
         ev (Equal a b)     = evalRat a env == evalRat b env
         ev (And p q)       = ev p  &&  ev q
         ev (Or  p q)       = ev p  ||  ev q
\end{code}

However, as soon as we encounter quantifiers, we have a problem.
%
To evaluate |EXISTS x p| (at least in certain contexts) we may need to
evaluate |p| for each possible value of |x|.
%
\label{sec:fol-undecidability}
But, unfortunately, there are infinitely many such possible values,
and so we can never know if the formula is a tautology.%
\footnote{FOL experts will scoff at this view, because they routinely
  use much more sophisticated methods of evaluation, which handle
  quantifiers in completely different ways.  Their methods are even
  able to identify tautologies as such. However, even such methods are
  not guaranteed to terminate on formulas which are not tautologies.
  Therefore, as long as an even-very-advanced FOL tautology-checker is
  running, there is no way to know how close it is to confirming if
  the formula at hand is a tautology or not. This is not a technical
  limitation, but rather a fundamental one, which boils down to the
  presence of quantifiers over an infinite domain.}
%
So, if we were to try and run the evaluator, it would not
terminate.
%
Hence, the best that we can ever do is, given a hand-written proof of
the formula, check if the proof is valid.
%
Fortunately, we have already studied the notion of proof in the
section on propositional logic, and it can be extended to
support quantifiers.

\subsection{Universal quantification}
\index{forall}%
\index{universal quantifier}%
%
Universal quantification (Forall or ∀) can be seen as a generalisation
of |And|.
%
To see this, we can begin by generalising the binary operator |And| to
an |n|-ary version: |Andn|.
%
To prove |Andn#(A1,A2, ..., An)| we need a proof of each |Ai|.
%
Thus we could define |Andn#(A1,A2, ..., An) = A1 & A2 & ... & An| where
|&| is the infix version of binary |And|.
%
The next step is to require the formulas |Ai| to be of the same form, i.e.\ the result of applying a constant function |A| to
the individual |i|.
%
And, we can think of the variable |i| ranging over the full set of
individuals |i1|, |i2|, \ldots.
%
Then the final step is to introduce the notation |Forall i (A#(i))| for
|A#(i1) & A#(i2) & ... |.
%

Now, a proof of |Forall x (A#(x))| should in some way contain a proof of
|A#(x)| for every possible |x|.
%
For the binary |And| we simply provide the two proofs, but in the
infinite case, we need an infinite collection of proofs.
%
To do so, a possible procedure is to introduce a fresh (meaning that
we know nothing about this new term) constant term |a| and prove
|A#(a)|.
%
Intuitively, if we can show |A#(a)| without knowing anything about |a|,
we have proved |Forall x (A#(x))|.
%
Another way to view this is to say that a proof of |Forall x (P x)| is
a function |f| from individuals to proofs such that |f t| is a proof
of |P t| for each term |t|.
%

So we can now extend our type for proofs: the introduction rule for
universal quantification is \(\frac{A(x) \quad \text{\(x\) fresh
  }}{∀x. A(x)}\).
%
The corresponding constructor can be |AllIntro :: (RatSem ->
Proof) -> Proof|.
%
(In Haskell we would use the textual syntax \(\Varid{AllIntro}\) for
|AllIntro|) and \(\Varid{AllElim}\) for |AllElim|.)

% TODO: A simple example might also be a good idea, where we end up
% with a function f where f t is a proof of P t for all terms t.
%

Note that the scoping rule for |Forall x b| is similar to the rule for
a function definition, |f x = b|, and for \addtoindex{anonymous
  function}s, |\x -> b|.
%
Just as in those cases we say that the variable |x| is \emph{bound} in
|b| and that the \emph{scope} of the variable binding extends until
the end of |b| (but not further).
%

One common source of confusion in mathematical (and other semi-formal)
texts is that variable binding is sometimes implicit.
%
A typical example is the notation for equations: for instance |x^2 +
2*x + 1 == 0| usually means roughly |Exists x (x^2 + 2*x + 1 == 0)|.
%
We write ``roughly'' here because in maths texts the scope of |x| very
often extends to some text after the equation where something more is
said about the solution |x|.%
\footnote{This phenomena seems to be borrowed from the behaviour of
quantifiers in natural language.
  %
  See for example \citep{DBLP:journals/jolli/BernardyCM21} for a
  discussion.}

Let us now consider the elimination rule for universal
quantification.
%
The idea here is that if |A#(x)| holds for every abstract individual
|x|, then it also holds for any concrete individual |a|:
\(\frac{∀x. A(x)}{A(a)}\).
%
As for |And| we had to provide the other argument to recover |p `And`
q|, here we have to be able reconstruct the general form |A#(x)| ---
indeed, it is not simply a matter of substituting |x| for |a|, because
there can be several occurrences of |a| in the formula to prove.
%
So, in fact, the proof constructor must contain the general form
|A#(x)|, for example as a function from individuals:
%
|AllElim :: (RatSem -> Prop) -> Proof -> Proof|.

Let us sketch the proof-checker cases corresponding to universal
quantification.
%
The introduction rule uses a new concept: |subst x a p|, which
replaces the variable |x| by |a| in |p|, but otherwise follows closely
our informal explanation:
%
\begin{spec}
proofChecker (AllIntro f a) (Forall x p) = proofChecker (f a') (subst x a' p)
  where a' = freshFor [a, Forall x p]
proofChecker (AllElim f t) p  =   checkUnify (f x') p
                              &&  proofChecker t (Forall x' (f x'))
  where x' = freshFor [f x, p]
\end{spec}
%
The eliminator uses |checkUnify| which verifies that |f x| is indeed a
generalisation of the formula to prove, |p|.
%
Finally we need a way to introduce fresh variables |freshFor|, which
conjures up a variable occurring nowhere in its argument list.

\subsection{Existential quantification}
\index{exists}%
\index{existential quantifier}%

%
We have already seen how the universal quantifier can be seen as a
generalisation of |And| and in the same way we can see the existential (∃)
quantifier as a generalisation of |Or|.
%

First we generalise the binary |Or| to an |n|-ary |Orn|.
%
To prove |Orn#(A1, A2, ..., An)| it is enough (and necessary) to find one
|i| for which we can prove |Ai|.
%
As before we then take the step from a family of formulas |Ai| to a single
unary predicate |A| expressing the formulas |A#(i)| for the (term)
variable |i|.
%
Then the final step is to take the disjunction of this infinite set of formulas
to obtain |Exists i (A#(i))|.

The introduction and elimination rules for existential quantification are:
%
\[
  \frac{P(a)}{∃i. P(i)}\hspace{10em}\frac{{∀x.P(x) → R}  \quad \quad ∃i. P(i)}{R}
\]
%
The introduction rule says that to prove the existential
quantification, we only need exhibit one witness ($a$) and one proof
for that member of the set of individuals.
%
For binary |Or| the ``family'' only had two members, one labelled
|Left| and one |Right|, and we effectively had one introduction rule
for each.
%
Here, for the generalisation of |Or|, we have unified the two rules
into one with an added parameter |a| corresponding to the label which
indicates the family member.

In the other direction, if we look at the binary elimination rule,
we see the need for two arguments to be sure of how to prove the
implication for any family member of the binary |Or|.
%
\begin{spec}
orElim      :: Or p q -> (p `Implies` r) -> (q `Implies` r) -> r
\end{spec}
%
The generalisation unifies these two to one family of arguments.
%
If we can prove |R| for each member of the family, we can be sure to
prove |R| when we encounter some family member.

The constructors for proofs can be |ExistsIntro :: RatSem -> Proof ->
Proof| and |ExistsElim :: Proof -> Proof -> Proof|.
%
In this case we would have |i| as the first argument of |ExistsIntro| and
a proof of |A#(i)| as its second argument.

\begin{exercise}
  Sketch the |proofChecker| cases for existential quantification.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Typed quantification}
\label{sec:TypedQuant}

So far, we have considered quantification always as over the full set
of individuals, but it is often convenient to quantify over a subset
with a certain property (like all even numbers, or all non-empty
sets).

Even though it is not usually considered as strictly part of FOL, it
does not fundamentally change its character if we extended it with
several types (or sorts) of individuals (one speaks of
``multi-sorted'' FOL).

In such a variant, the quantifiers look like |Forall (x:S) (P x)| and
|Exists (x:S) (P x)|.

Indeed, if a type (a set) |S| of terms can be described as those that
satisfy the unary predicate |T| we can understand |Forall (x:T) (P x)| as a
shorthand for |Forall x (T x) => P x|.
%
Likewise we can understand |Exists (x:T) (P x)| as a shorthand for |Exists x (T x
& P x)|.

As hinted at in the previous chapters, we find that writing types
explicitly can greatly help understanding, and we won't refrain from
writing down types in quantifiers in FOL formulas.

\begin{exercise}
  Prove that the De Morgan dual of typed universal quantification is
  the typed existential quantification, using the above translation to
  untyped quantification.

%TODO: include somewhere as a solution.
%   not (Exists (x:T) (P x))          = {- Def. of typed quantification -}
%   not (Exists x (T x & P x))        = {- de-Morgan for existential    -}
%   Forall x (not (T x & P x))        = {- de-Morgan for and            -}
%   Forall x (not (T x) | not (P x))  = {- |(A => B)  ==  (not A | B)|  -}
%   Forall x (T x => not (P x))       = {- Def. of typed quantification -}
%   Forall (x:T) (not (P x))

\end{exercise}

\subsection{Curry-Howard for quantification over individuals}

We can try and draw parallels with a hypothetical programming
language corresponding to FOL.
%
In such a programming language, we expect to be able to encode proof
rules as follows (we must use a \emph{dependent} function type here,
|(a:A) → B|, see below)

\begin{spec}
  allIntro    :: ((a : Individual) -> P a) -> (Forall x (P x))
  allElim     :: (Forall x (P x)) -> ((a : Individual) -> P a)

  existIntro  :: (a : Individual) -> P a -> Exists x (P x)
  existsElim  :: ((a:Individual) -> P a `Implies` R) -> (Exists x (P x)) `Implies` R
\end{spec}


Taking the intuitionistic version of FOL (with the same treatment of
negation as for propositional logic), we additionally expect to be
able to represent proofs of quantifiers, directly. That is:
\begin{quote}
|(t, bt)| is a program of type |Exists x (P x)| if |bt| has type |P t|.

|f| is a program of type |Forall x (P x)| if |f t| has type |P t| for all |t|.
\end{quote}

Unfortunately, in its 2010 standard, Haskell does not provide the
equivalent of quantification over individuals.
%
Therefore, one would have to use a different tool than Haskell as a
proof assistant for (intuitionistic) FOL.
%
The quantification that Haskell provides (|forall a? ...|) is \emph{over
  types} rather than individuals.
%
What we would need is:
%
1.\ a type corresponding to universal quantification, the dependent
function type |(a:A) → B|, and
%
2.\ a type corresponding to |Exists (x:A) (P x)|, the dependent pair
|(x:A, P x)|.

We can recommend the language Agda \citep{Norell09dependentlytyped} or
Idris \citep{citeulike:14291916} if you want to express these directly
in the language (as done in \citep{DBLP:conf/mpc/MuKJ08,
  DBLP:journals/jfp/MuKJ09, DBLP:conf/ifl/IonescuJ12,
  DBLP:journals/jfp/BottaJI17}).
%
However, in order to avoid a multiplicity of tools and potentially an
excessive emphasis on proof formalism, we will refrain from formalising
proofs as Agda or Idris programs in the remainder.
%
Rather, in the rest of the chapter, we will illustrate the logical
principles seen so far by examples.

\subsection{\extraMaterial More general code for first order languages}
\jp{We actually don't used the specialisation to rationals. But it can be useful to
    fix ideas. Turn this into an exercise?}

It is possible to make one generic implementation of |FOL| which can
be specialised to any first order language.


\begin{itemize}
\item |Term| = Syntactic terms
\item |n| = names (of atomic terms)
\item |f| = function names
\item |v| = variable names

\item |p| = predicate names
\end{itemize}
