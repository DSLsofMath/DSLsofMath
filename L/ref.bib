                  theory of policy advice and avoidability. More
                  specifically, we formalize a cluster of notions
                  related to policy advice, such as policy, viability,
                  reachability, and propose a novel approach for
                  assisting decision making, based on the concept of
                  avoidability. We formalize avoidability as a
                  relation between current and future states,
                  investigate under which conditions this relation is
                  decidable and propose a generic procedure for
                  assessing avoidability. The formalization is
                  constructive and makes extensive use of the
                  correspondence between dependent types and logical
                  propositions, decidable judgments are obtained
                  through computations. Thus, we aim for a
                  computational theory, and emphasize the role that
                  computer science can play in global system science.}

  abstract =     {Quick Check is a tool which aids the Haskell
                  programmer in formulating and testing properties of
                  programs. Properties are described as Haskell
                  functions, and can be automatically tested on random
                  input, but it is also possible to define custom test
                  data generators. We present a number of case
                  studies, in which the tool was successfully used,
                  and also point out some pitfalls to avoid. Random
                  testing is especially suitable for functional
                  programs because properties can be stated at a fine
                  grain. When a function is built from separately
                  tested components, then random testing suffices to
                  obtain good coverage of the definition under test.},
