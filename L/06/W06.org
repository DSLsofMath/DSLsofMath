Learning outcomes:

* Power Series:
** (last week) "polynomial" division
** definitions of deriv and integ
** transformation from semantics (ODE) to syntax (coefficient equations)
+ f x = f 0 + \int_0^x f'   -- semantics
+ fs = integ (f 0) fs'      -- syntax, with f = eval fs
** solving differential equations "by hand"
+ expx,
+ sinx, cosx
  si = [0,  1,  0  ,-1/6, 0   , ...]
  co = [1,  0, -1/2,  0 , 1/24, ...]
+ f' + 2f = sin, f 0 = 1
  fs' = si - 2*fs
  fs  = integ 1 fs'
* evalAll: a stream of all derivatives
