% TODO: Add some exercises to get comfortable with the stuff that is used in the
% exam questions below.
%

% TODO (by DaHe): How to phrase this question better? It feels a bit clumsy
% right now.

\begin{exercise} \label{exc:findFunExp}

  As shown in \cref{exc:findFunExp0}, we can find expressions |e ::
  FunExp| such that |eval e = f| automatically using the assignment |e
  = f X|.
  %
  This is possible thanks to the |Ring|, |Transcendental|, etc.\
  instances of |FunExp|.
  %
  Use this method to find |FunExp| representations of the functions
  below, and show step by step how the application of the function to
  |X| is evaluated in each case.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item |f1 x = x^2 + 4|
  \item |f2 x = 7 * exp( 2 + 3*x )|
  \item |f3 x = 1 / (sin x + cos x)|
  \end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{exc:derivFunExp}
  \index{derive@@|derive|{}}%
%
  For each of the expressions |e :: FunExp| you found in
  Exercise~\ref{exc:findFunExp}, use |derive| to find an expression
  |e' :: FunExp| representing the derivative of the expression, and
  verify that |e'| is indeed the derivative of |e|.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  At the start of this chapter, we saw three different ways of computing the
  value of the derivative of a function at a given point:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Using |FunExp|
  \item Using |FD|
  \item Using pairs
  \end{enumerate}

  Try using each of these methods to find the values of |f1' 2|, |f2'
  2|, and |f3' 2|, i.e.\ the derivatives of each of the functions in
  Exercise~\ref{exc:findFunExp}, evaluated at the point~2.
  %
  You can verify that the result is correct by comparing it with the
  expressions |e1'|, |e2'| and |e3'| that you found in
  \ref{exc:derivFunExp}.

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  The exponential function |exp t = {-"e^t"-}| has the property that
  \(\int e^t dt = e^t + C\).
  %
  Use this fact to express the functions below as |PowerSeries| using
  |integ|.
  %
  \textit{Hint: the definitions will be recursive}.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item |\t -> exp t  |
    \item |\t -> exp (3*t)|
    \item |\t -> 3 * exp (2*t)|
  \end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  In the chapter, we saw that a representation |expx :: PowerSeries|
  of the exponential function can be implemented using |solve| as
  |expx = solve 1 id|.
  %
  Use the same method to implement power series representations of the
  following functions:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item |\t -> exp (3*t)|
    \item |\t -> 3 * exp (2*t)|
  \end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \leavevmode

  Implement |sinx| and |cosx| using |solve| instead of a recursive
  definition.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

  Consider the following differential equation:

  $$f''\, t + f'\, t - 2 * f\, t = e^{3 * t},\quad f\, 0 = 1,\quad f'\, 0 = 2$$

  We will solve this equation assuming that |f| can be expressed by a power
  series |fs|, and finding the three first coefficients of |fs|.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement |expx3 :: PowerSeries REAL|, a power series representation of
      $e^{3 * t}$

    \item Find an expression for |fs''|, the second derivative of |fs|, in terms
      of |expx3|, |fs'|, and |fs|.

    \item Find an expression for |fs'| in terms of |fs''|, using |integ|.

    \item Find an expression for |fs| in terms of |fs'|, using |integ|.

    \item Use |takePoly| to find the first three coefficients of |fs|.
      %
      You can check that your solution is correct using a tool such as
      MATLAB or WolframAlpha, by first finding an expression for |f
      t|, and then getting the Taylor series expansion for that
      expression.

  \end{enumerate}
