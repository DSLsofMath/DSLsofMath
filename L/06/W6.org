* Power Series
+ Last week we talked mainly about the domain-specific language of polynomials and how that matches the Ring class.
+ Now we extend the language handle many more (continuous) functions by moving to power series.
+ The pay-off is the ability to compute (approximate) solutions to ordinarie differential equations.
** Learning outcomes for this week
+ KU.DSL      = design and implement a DSL for power series
+ KU.Explain  = explain main concepts of elementary real analysis
+ SA.Notation = develop adequate notation for mathematical concepts
+ SA.Power    = *use power series for solving differential equations*
+ JA = discuss and compare different software implementations of
  mathematical concepts

** transformation from semantics (ODE) to syntax (coefficient equations)
+ f x = f 0 + \int_0^x f'   -- semantics
+ fs = integ (f 0) fs'      -- syntax, with f = eval fs

* (Thursday lecture) Maclaurin series
+ file:Live_6_3_2025.lhs
+ A2 deadline reminder: Tuesday 2026-03-03:
** der & integ spec
** Maclaurin series = Taylor series at the point zero
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series
+ See blackboard
+ Main use: "local approximation"
+ Let M n f be the "order n" approximation of f near 0:
  M : Nat -> (R->R) -> (R->R)
  M 0 f x = f 0
  M 1 f x = f 0 + (f' 0)*x
  M 2 f x = f 0 + (f' 0)*x + (f'' 0 / 2)*x^2
  ...
  M n f x = M (n-1) f x + (D^n f 0 / fact n)*x^n
+ As n -> inf we get a power series
  (which will equal f inside the radius of convergence)
** Maclaurin big picture: a transformation in three stages
  f
-> compute all derivatives
  [f, f', f'', ...]
-> apply all of them to 0
  [f 0, f' 0, f'' 0, ...]
-> divide by factorials
  [(f 0)/0!, (f' 0)/1!, (f'' 0)/2!, ...]

In the lecture we work through the different steps with examples and
motivation / explanation.
** Live coding DS = Derivative Stream: a stream of all derivatives
+ Context: think of writing eval :: ... => FunExp -> (a -> a)
  in such a way that you can get (all) derivatives as well
+ [[file:Live_6_3_FunExp.lhs]]
+ Introduce classes Algebraic(sqrt), Transcendental(pi,sin,cos,exp)
+ See file:Live_6_3_2025.lhs for instances
** Perhaps: Live coding "solving ODEs with Power Series" (file:Live_6_2.lhs)
+ DS instances for MulGroup and Transcendental
