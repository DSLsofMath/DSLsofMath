** Concrete logic example
data E where  Mul :: E->E->E   -- mul :: S -> S -> S
              Add :: E->E->E   -- add :: S -> S -> S
              Zer :: E         -- zer :: S
type S = REAL -> REAL

  P(h) = " h is a homomorphism from E to S "
  State and simplify not P(eval') where eval' = D . eval

+ P(h) = Exists mul, add, zer. H2(h,Mul,mul) & H2(h,Add,add) & H0(h,Zer,zer)

Calculate:

  not P(eval')
= -- Def. of P
  not (Exists mul, add, zer. H2(eval',Mul,mul) & H2(eval',Add,add) & H0(eval',Zer,zer))
= -- By not-propagation ("not Exists ~ Forall not")
  Forall mul, add, zer. not (H2(eval',Mul,mul) & H2(eval',Add,add) & H0(eval',Zer,zer)))
= -- de Morgan laws
  Forall mul, add, zer. (not H2(eval',Mul,mul)) | (not H2(eval',Add,add)) | (not H0(eval',Zer,zer))

Pick the first term
  not H2(eval',Mul,mul)
= -- Def. of H2
  not (Forall x, y. eval' (Mul x y) = mul (eval' x) (eval' y)

Now the proof can continue in the same way as the examples earlier
which were not homomorphisms (|isPrime :: Nat -> Bool| and |eval' ::
FunExp -> (R->R)|, both in Chapter 4): assume an operator (mul here)
exists and satisfies H2, then show (by picking suitable examples for x
and y) that this leads to a contradiction.

* Power Series
+ Last week we talked mainly about the domain-specific language of
  polynomials and how that matches the Ring class.
+ Now we extend the language handle many more (continuous) functions
  by moving to power series.
+ The pay-off is the ability to compute (approximate) solutions to
  ordinarie differential equations.

* (Thursday lecture) Maclaurin series
+ file:Live_6_3_2025.lhs
** Maclaurin series = Taylor series at the point zero
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series
+ See blackboard
+ Main use: "local approximation"
+ Let M n f be the "order n" approximation of f near 0:  
  M : Nat -> (R->R) -> (R->R)
  M 0 f x = f 0 
  M 1 f x = f 0 + (f' 0)*x
  M 2 f x = f 0 + (f' 0)*x + (f'' 0 / 2)*x^2
  ...
  M n f x = M (n-1) f x + (D^n f 0 / fact n)*x^n
+ As n -> inf we get a power series
  (which will equal f inside the radius of convergence)
** Maclaurin big picture: a transformation in three stages
  f
-> compute all derivatives
  [f, f', f'', ...]
-> apply all of them to 0
  [f 0, f' 0, f'' 0, ...]
-> divide by factorials
  [(f 0)/0!, (f' 0)/1!, (f'' 0)/2!, ...]

In the lecture we work through the different steps with examples and
motivation / explanation.
** Live coding DS = Derivative Stream: a stream of all derivatives
+ Context: think of writing eval :: ... => FunExp -> (a -> a)
  in such a way that you can get (all) derivatives as well
+ [[file:Live_6_3_FunExp.lhs]]
+ Introduce classes Algebraic(sqrt), Transcendental(pi,sin,cos,exp)
+ See file:Live_6_3_2025.lhs for instances
** Perhaps: Live coding "solving ODEs with Power Series" (file:Live_6_2.lhs)
+ DS instances for MulGroup and Transcendental
