## Course team

* Examiner & main lecturer: Patrik Jansson (patrikj AT)
* Guest lecturer: Cezar Ionescu (cezar AT)
* Teaching assistant: Daniel Schoepe (schoepe AT)
* (Project assistants: Daniel Heurlin, Sólrún Einarsdóttir)

## Objectives

The course presents classical mathematical topics from a computing
science perspective: giving specifications of the concepts introduced,
paying attention to syntax and types, and ultimately constructing DSLs
of some mathematical areas mentioned below.

Learning outcomes as in the
[course syllabus](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course?course_id=26170).

* Knowledge and understanding
    * design and implement a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for a new domain
    * organize areas of mathematics in DSL terms
    * explain main concepts of elementary real and complex analysis, algebra, and linear algebra
* Skills and abilities
    * develop adequate notation for mathematical concepts
    * perform calculational proofs
    * use power series for solving differential equations
    * use Laplace transforms for solving differential equations
* Judgement and approach
    * discuss and compare different software implementations of mathematical concepts

The course is elective for both computer science and mathematics
students at both Chalmers and GU.

## Course material

[Lecture notes](L/snapshots/) + references therein cover the course but there is no
printed course textbook.

The main references are listed below.

## Course setup

* Lectures (Tue. 13–15 and Thu 13–15 in EB. [[TimeEdit]](https://se.timeedit.net/web/chalmers/db1/public/ri157375X39Z06Q5Z46g0Y30y5096Y35Q01gQY5Q55767.html))

    * 2018-03-05 Thu lecture + ex. **moved earlier to Mon at 10 and 15.15**.

## Changes from last year

The main changes for 2018 (based on the [course eval meeting](eval/2017-04-28.md)) are

* New course literature (lecture notes covering the full course)
* More material on functional programming in Haskell
* Developed more exercises to solve (primarily easier exercises to start each week with)
* More solving of exercises at the whiteboard
* Schedule changes (alternating L, E, L, E instead of L, L, E, E)
* Weekly hand-ins to encourage students to spend more hours on the course (not part of the formal examination)

One of the student evaluators from 2017 (DaHe) was hired part time to help out with these improvements.

## Examination

There are two compulsory course elements:

* A = Assignments (written + oral examination in groups of three students)
    * two compulsory hand-in assignments (2018-01-30, 2018-02-27)
    * Grading: Pass or fail
    * The assignments are to be handed in via [Fire](https://dslm-lp3-18.frs.cse.chalmers.se)
* E Exam (individual written exam at the end of the course)
    * Grading: **Chalmers**: U, 3, 4, 5; **GU**: U, G, VG
    * Date: [2018-03-13 at 14.00](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course?course_id=26170)
    * Aids: One textbook of your choice

To pass the course you need to pass both course elements.

## Lectures

The latest PDF snapshot of the full lecture notes can be found in
[L/snapshots](L/snapshots/).

The "source code" for the lecture notes are in subdirectories of
L/: [L/01/](L/01), [L/02/](L/02/), etc.

## Exercises

Chapter 1–8 of the Lecture Notes end with weekly exercises for weeks
1–8.

In [L/RecEx.md](L/RecEx.md) you will find a list of recommended exercises
for each chapter of the lecture notes.

## Using the DSLsofMath

In order to do some of the exercises, you may need/want to have access to the
DSLs introduced during the lectures and in the lecture notes.

To do this, first make sure you have installed
[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). Next, download [this
tarball](L/DSLsofMath-0.1.9.1.tar.gz) and extract it in a desired location (on
Linux and Mac, you can do this by running `tar -zxf DSLsofMath-x.x.x.x.tar.gz
` in the terminal. In Windows, you might have to use a tool like
[7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/)).

Now go into the extracted folder `DSLsofMath-x.x.x.x/` and run `stack init`. You can now interact with
the code from the lectures by typing `stack ghci`, which puts you in ghci with all
DSLs loaded. You can also place your own haskell files inside this folder and import the DSLs you
want by typing the following at the start of your file:

```haskell
import DSLsofMath.W0X
```
where X is the chapter that contains the code you want to use. You should be
able to load your own haskell files in normal ghci.
