2016-08-24: Planning for the 2017 instance of the DSLsofMath course

L1-L4: redo:

* L1: Start with small language for arithmetic expressions (known to local students from the Intro FP course) + evaluator. Still with the aim to explain syntax, semantics and Haskell.
* L2(+3): propositional calculus + "german" quantifiers
* L4: try to include parts of L14
* L5: Good
* L6+L9: Core
* L10-13: Core applications
* L7+8 (guest lectures) will probably move to L11-12

TODO: introduce some (probability theory / statistics / discrete math)
  connecting to the most recent math course for the CSE BSc students:
