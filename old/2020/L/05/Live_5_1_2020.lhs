From polynomial function to a polynomial (parsing?):

Specification: (naming: "lave" = reverse "eval")
  lave :: Fractional a => Int -> (a->a) -> Poly a
  forall x. eval (lave n f) x = f x

(Should work if f is actually a polynomial function of degree n.)

General idea: evaluate the polynomial at (n+1) points and solve for the coefficients.
Best choice of points are (n+1)-roots of unity.

\begin{code}

i = 0:+1
coeff :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer -> Complex Double
coeff n j k = exp(2*pi*i*fromRational ((j*k) % (n+1)))
  where
lave n f = as
  where (_xs, _ys, as) = lave' n f

lave' n f = (xs, ys, map a [0..n])
  where
    xs = map (coeff n (-1)) [0..n]
    ys = map f xs
    a j = sum (zipWith (*) ys (map (coeff n j) [0..n])) / fromInteger (n+1)

test :: Integer -> [String]
test n = map ((printf "%5.1f").realPart) (lave n (ch n))
\end{code}
