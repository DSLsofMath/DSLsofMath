Exercises for 2015-02-24 and 25
===============================

Fill in the gaps in Lectures 10 and 11.  In particular:

- give a derivation for the definition of `*` for polynomials (Lecture
  10)

- check that, with the definition of `x = [0, 1]` in Lecture 10 we
  really have

<  as = a0 + a1 * x + a2 * x^2 + ... + an * x^n

- implement `idx'`, `sinx'` and `cosx'` using `solve` (Lecture 11)

- complete the instance `Floating (PowerSeries a)` (Lecture 11).
