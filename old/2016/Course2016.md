2016-08-12: Review session and exam coming up
   As the re-exam for "DSLs of Maths" will take place on the 23rd of August (Tuesday in a week), I invite you (especially those who need to take the re-exam) to a review session.  We will focus on the subjects of the mock exam and those of the real exam, since the re-exam will be similar.

   When:  2016-08-19 (Friday) 10:00--12:00
   Where: [ES51](http://maps.chalmers.se/#abb49f72-9df3-42c4-9298-788edba3090c) (in [Linsen](http://maps.chalmers.se/#a42ded06-d12f-40bb-900a-b4388e80cbac), [EDIT-building](http://maps.chalmers.se/#3d288de3-e2dd-49e1-bbed-e62178e60a0e))

   I look forward to seeing (at least some of) you there!

   Best wishes,

   Cezar

Aim
---

The course will present classical mathematical topics from a computing
science perspective: giving specifications of the concepts introduced,
paying attention to syntax and types, and ultimately constructing DSLs
of some mathematical areas mentioned below.

Literature
----------

There is no course textbook.  We will use many sources: references
will be provided in the lecture summaries.

Some important references:

### Functional programming

- **Thinking Functionally with Haskell**, Richard Bird, Cambridge
  University Press, 2014
  [URL](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/books/functional/)
- **Introduction to Functional Programming Using Haskell**, Richard
  Bird, Prentice-Hall, 1998.  A previous (but *very* different)
  version of the above.
- **An Introduction to Functional Programming**, Richard Bird and Phil
  Wadler, Prentice-Hall, 1988. A previous (but *very* different)
  version of *both* of the above.

### DSLs

- **Functional Programming for Domain-Specific Languages**, Jeremy
  Gibbons.  In *Central European Functional Programming School 2015*,
  LNCS 8606, 2015.
  [URL](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-15940-9_1)

  This is currently *the* standard reference to DSLs for the
  functional programmer.

- **Folding Domain-Specific Languages: Deep and Shallow Embeddings**,
  Jeremy Gibbons and Nicolas Wu,
  ICFP 2014. [URL](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/publication7584-abstract.html)

  Available at the same link: a highly recommended
  [short version](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jeremy.gibbons/publications/embedding-short.pdf)
  and the two videos of Jeremy presenting the most important ideas
  of DSLs in a very accessible way.

- **Programming Languages**, Mike Spivey.  Lecture notes of a course
  given at the CS Department in Oxford.  Useful material for
  understanding the design and implementation of embedded DSLs.
  [URL](http://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/corner/Programming_Languages)

- **Domain-Specific Languages**, Martin Fowler, 2011.
  [URL](http://martinfowler.com/books/dsl.html)

  The view from the object-oriented programming perspective.

### The computer science perspective

- **Communicating Mathematics: Useful Ideas from Computer Science**,
  Charles Wells, *American Mathematical Monthly*, May 1995.  [URL](http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/math/wells/pub/pdf/commath.pdf)

  This article was one of the main triggers of this course.

### Mathematics

- **The Language of First-Order Logic, 3rd Edition**, Jon Barwise and John
  Etchemendy, 1993.  Out of print, but you can get it for one penny
  from Amazon UK.  A vast improvement over its successors (as Tony
  Hoare said about Algol 60).

- **Mathematics: Form and Function**, Saunders Mac Lane, Springer 1986.
  An overview of the relationships between the many mathematical
  domains.  Entertaining, challenging, rewarding.
  [Fulltext from the library](http://chalmers.summon.serialssolutions.com/sv-SE/search?ho=t&q=Mathematics%3A%20Form%20and%20Function)

- **Functional Differential Geometry**, Gerald Jay Sussman and Jack
  Wisdom, 2013, MIT.  A book about using programming as a means of
  understanding differential geometry.  Similar in spirit to the course,
  but more advanced and very different in form.  An earlier version
  appeared as an [AIM report](http://web.mit.edu/wisdom/www/AIM-2005-003.pdf).

More references will be added in due course.
