Note: the Laplace lecture introduces the Laplace transform by analogy
to the PowerSeries. Then PowerSeries is employed to define functions
like exp, sin, cos recursively using integ. It would be nice to check
if a similar approach could be used to define certain functions by
their Laplace transform (or the opposite).
