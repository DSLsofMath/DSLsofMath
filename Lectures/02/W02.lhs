\subsection{A few words about pure set theory}

One way to build mathematics from the ground up is to start from pure
set theory and define all concepts by translation to sets.
%
We will only work with this as a mathematical domain to study, not as
``the right way'' of doing mathematics.
%
The core of the language of pure set theory has the Empty set, the
one-element set constructor Singleton, set Union, and Intersection.
%
There are no ``atoms'' or ``elements'' to start from except for the
empty set but it turns out that quite a large part of mathematics can
still be expressed.

\paragraph{Natural numbers} To talk about things like natural numbers
in pure set theory they need to be encoded. Here is one such encoding
(which is explored further in the first hand-in assignment).

\begin{spec}
vonNeumann 0        =  Empty
vonNeumann (n + 1)  =  Union  (vonNeumann n)
                              (Singleton (vonNeumann n))
\end{spec}

\paragraph{Pairs}

Definition:  A pair |(a,b)| is encoded as |{{a},{a,b}}|.

% (a,b) \coloneqq \big\{\,\{a\},\{a,b\}\,\big\} ;

\subsection{Propositional Calculus}

Now we turn to the main topic of this week: logic and proofs.

TODO: type up the notes + whiteboard photos

Swedish: Satslogik

False, True, And, Or, Implies

\subsection{First Order Logic (predicate logic)}

TODO: type up the notes + whiteboard photos

Adds term variables and functions, predicate symbols and quantifiers (sv: kvantorer).

\subsection{Basic concepts of calculus}

\paragraph{Limit point} TODO: transcribe the 2016 notes + 2017 black board
pictures into notes.

\emph{Definition} (adapted from \cite{rudin1964principles}, page 28):
Let |X| be a subset of |ℝ|.
%
A point |p ∈ ℝ| is a limit point of |X| if for every |ε > 0|, there
exists |q ∈ X| such that |q ≠ p| and |abs(q - p) < ε|.

\begin{spec}
Limp : ℝ → 𝒫 ℝ → Prop
Limp p X = ∀ ε > 0? ∃ q ∈ X - {p}? abs (q-p) < ε
\end{spec}
%
Notice that |q| depends on |ε|.
%
Thus by introducing a function |getq| we can move the |∃| out.

\begin{spec}
type Q = {-"ℝ_{> 0}"-} → (X - {p})
Limp p X = ∃ getq : Q? ∀ ε > 0? |getq ε - p| < ε
\end{spec}

Next: introduce the ``disk function'' |Di|.

\begin{spec}
Di : ℝ → {-"ℝ_{> 0}"-} → 𝒫 ℝ
Di c r = {x | abs (x - c) < r}
\end{spec}
Then we get
\begin{spec}
Limp p X = ∃ getq : Q? ∀ ε > 0? getq ε ∈ Di p ε
\end{spec}

Example: limit outside the set |X|

\begin{spec}
X = {1/n | n ∈ Pos }
\end{spec}

Show that |0| is a limit point of |X|.
%
Note that |0 ∉ X|.

We want to prove |Limp 0 X|

\begin{spec}
getq ε = 1/n where n = ceiling (1/ε)
\end{spec}

(where the definition of |n| comes from a calculation showing the
property involving |Di| is satisfied.)

Exercise: prove that |0| is the \emph{only} limit point of |X|.

\emph{Proposition}: If |X| is finite, then it has no limit points.

\begin{spec}
∀ p ∈ ℝ? not (Limp p X)
\end{spec}

Good excercise in quantifier negation!

\begin{spec}
f : (q : Q) → RPos   {- such that |let ε = f q in q ε ∉ Di p ε| -}
\end{spec}

Note that |q ε| is in (TODO: To be cont.)




\paragraph{The limit of a sequence} TODO: transcribe the 2016 notes +
2017 black board pictures into notes.

\begin{spec}
P a ε L = (ε > 0) → ∃ N : ℤ? (∀ n : ℕ? (n ≥ N) → (|an - L| < ε))
\end{spec}


\subsection{Questions and answers from the exercise sessions week 2}

\paragraph{Variables, |Env| and |lookup|}

This was a frequently source of confusion already the first week so
there is already a question + answers earlier in this text.
%
But here is an additional example to help clarify the matter.
\begin{code}
data Rat v = RV v | FromI Integer | RPlus (Rat v) (Rat v) | RDiv (Rat v) (Rat v)
  deriving (Eq, Show)

newtype RatSem = RSem (Integer, Integer)
\end{code}
We have a type |Rat v| for the syntax trees of rational number
expressions and a type |RatSem| for the semantics of those rational
number expressions as pairs of integers.
%
The constructor |RV :: v -> Rat v| is used to embed variables with
names of type |v| in |Rat v|.
%
We could use |String| instead of |v| but with a type parameter |v| we
get more flexibility at the same time as we get better feedback from
the type checker.
%
To evaluate some |e :: Rat v| we need to know how to evaluate the
variables we encounter.
%
What does ``evaluate'' mean for a variable?
%
Well, it just means that we must be able to translate a variable name
(of type |v|) to a semantic value (a rational number in this case).
%
To ``translate a name to a value'' we can use a function (of type |v
-> RatSem|) so we can give the following implementation of the
evaluator:
%
\begin{code}
evalRat1 ::  (v -> RatSem) -> (Rat v -> RatSem)
evalRat1 ev (RV v)       = ev v
evalRat1 ev (FromI i)    = fromISem i
evalRat1 ev (RPlus l r)  = plusSem  (evalRat1 ev l) (evalRat1 ev r)
evalRat1 ev (RDiv  l r)  = divSem   (evalRat1 ev l) (evalRat1 ev r)
\end{code}
Notice that we simply added a parameter |ev| for ``evaluate variable''
to the evaluator.
%
The rest of the definition follows a common pattern: recursively
translate each subexpression and apply the corresponding semantic
operation to combine the results: |RPlus| is replaced by |plusSem|,
etc.
%
\begin{code}
fromISem :: Integer -> RatSem
fromISem i = RSem (i, 1)

plusSem :: RatSem -> RatSem -> RatSem
plusSem = undefined -- TODO: exercise

-- Division of rational numbers
divSem :: RatSem -> RatSem -> RatSem
divSem (RSem (a, b)) (RSem (c, d)) = RSem (a*d, b*c)
\end{code}

Often the first argument |ev| to the eval function is constructed from
a list of pairs:
\begin{code}
type Env v s = [(v, s)]
envToFun :: (Show v, Eq v) => Env v s -> (v -> s)
envToFun [] v = error ("envToFun: variable "++ show v ++" not found")
envToFun ((w,s):env) v
  | w == v     = s
  | otherwise  = envToFun env v
\end{code}
Thus, |Env v s| can be seen as an implementation of a ``lookup
table''.
%
It could also be implemented using hash tables or binary search trees,
but efficiency is not the point here.
%
Finally, with |envToFun| in our hands we can implement a second
version of the evaluator:
\begin{code}
evalRat2 :: (Show v, Eq v) => (Env v RatSem) -> (Rat v -> RatSem)
evalRat2 env e = evalRat1 (envToFun env) e
\end{code}

\paragraph{The law of the excluded middle}

Many had problems with implementing the ``law of the excluded middle''
in the exercises and it is indeed a tricky property to prove.
%
They key to implementing it lies in double negation and as that is
encoded with higher order functions it gets a bit hairy.

TODO[Daniel]: more explanation

\paragraph{SET and PRED}

Several groups have had trouble grasping the difference between |SET|
and |PRED|.
%
This is understandable, beacuse we have so far in the lectures mostly
talked about term syntax + semantics, and not so much about predicate
syntax and semantics.
%
The one example of terms + predicates covered in the lectures is
Predicate Logic and I never actually showed how eval (for the
expressions) and check (for the predicates) is implemented.

As an example we can we take our terms to be the rational number
expressions defined above and define a type of predicates over those
terms:
\begin{code}
type Term v = Rat v

data RPred v  =  Equal     (Term v) (Term v)
              |  LessThan  (Term v) (Term v)
              |  Positive  (Term v)

              |  And  (RPred v) (RPred v)
              |  Not  (RPred v)
  deriving (Eq, Show)
\end{code}
%
Note that the first three constructors, |Eq|, |LessThan|, and
|Positive|, describe predicates or relations between terms (which can contain term
variables)
%
while the two last constructors, |And| and |Not|, just combine such
relations together.
%
(Terminology: I often mix the words ``predicate'' and ``relation''.)

We have already defined the evaluator for the |Term v| type but we
need to add a corresponding ``evaluator'' (called |check|) for the
|RPred v| type.
%
Given values for all term variables the predicate checker should just
determine if the predicate is true or false.
\begin{code}
checkRP :: (Eq v, Show v) => Env v RatSem -> RPred v -> Bool
checkRP env (Equal     t1 t2)  = eqSem        (evalRat2 env t1) (evalRat2 env t2)
checkRP env (LessThan  t1 t2)  = lessThanSem  (evalRat2 env t1) (evalRat2 env t2)
checkRP env (Positive  t1)     = positiveSem  (evalRat2 env t1)

checkRP env (And p q)  = (checkRP env p) && (checkRP env q)
checkRP env (Not p)    = not (checkRP env p)
\end{code}
Given this recursive definition of |checkRP|, the semantic functions
|eqSem|, |lessThanSem|, and |positiveSem| can be defined by just
working with the rational number representation:
\begin{code}
eqSem        :: RatSem -> RatSem -> Bool
lessThanSem  :: RatSem -> RatSem -> Bool
positiveSem  :: RatSem -> Bool
eqSem        = error "TODO"
lessThanSem  = error "TODO"
positiveSem  = error "TODO"
\end{code}

\subsection{More general code for first order languages}

``överkurs''

It is possible to make one generic implementation which can be
specialised to any first order language.

\item |Term| = Syntactic terms
\item |n| = names (of atomic terms)
\item |f| = function names

data WFF n f v p =
     P p    [Term n f v]
  |  Equal  (Term n f v)   (Term n f v)

  |  And    (WFF n f v p)  (WFF n f v p)
