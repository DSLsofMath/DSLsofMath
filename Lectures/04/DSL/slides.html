# Lecture 7: Domain Specific Languages

## Learning outcomes for L7

This lecture we will focus on the following subset of the full
DSLsofMath course learning outcomes:
* design and implement a DSL for a new domain
* organize areas of mathematics in DSL terms
* develop adequate notation for mathematical concepts
* discuss and compare different software implementations of mathematical concepts

---

## A tiny DSL of time-varying signals

* *Types* modelling concepts in the domain
```Haskell
type Time      = Double
type Signal a  = Time -> a
```
* *Constructor functions* constructing elements of these types
```Haskell
constS ::  a -> Signal a
```

* *Run functions* making observations of the elements
```Haskell
sample :: Signal a -> (Time -> a)
```

* *Combinators* combining and modifying elements

```Haskell
addS :: Num a => Signal a -> Signal a -> Signal a
mulS :: Num a => Signal a -> Signal a -> Signal a
```
```Haskell
mapS    :: (a->b) -> Signal a -> Signal b
speedUp :: Double -> Signal a -> Signal a
```

---

## Signal examples

```Haskell
s1 : Signal Double
s1 = sin

s2 :: Signal Bool
s2 = mapS (>=0) s1

s3, s4, s5 :: Signal Double
s3 = addS (constS 2) s1
s4 = mulS (constS 0.4) (speedUp 5 s1)
s5 = addS s3 s4
```

Additional combinators:

```Haskell
mapS2  :: (a->b->c) -> Signal a -> Signal b -> Signal c
($$)   :: Signal (a -> b) -> Signal a -> Signal b
```


---

## Primitive and derived operations

* A primitive operation is defined exploiting the definitions of the involved types
```Haskell
timeS :: Signal Time
timeS = \t -> t
```

* A derived operation can be defined purely in terms of other operations

```Haskell
addS :: Num a => Signal a -> Signal a -> Signal a
addS = mapS2 (+)

mapS :: (a -> b) -> Signal a -> Signal b
mapS f sa  =  constS f  $$  sa
```

---
# The anatomy of an embedded domain specific language

* *Types* modelling concepts in the domain: Time, Signal
* *Constructor functions* constructing elem's of these types: constS, timeS, ...
* *Combinators* combining and modifying elements: addS, ($$), mapS
* *Run functions* making observations of the elements: sample

---


## Think about

* Compositionality
    * Combining elements into more complex ones should be easy and natural
* Abstraction
    * The user shouldn't have to know (or be allowed to exploit) the underlying implementation of your types
    * Changing the implementation shouldn't break user code

---

## Implementation of an EDSL

* Shallow embedding
    * Represent elements by their semantics (what observations they support)
    * Constructor functions and combinators do most of the work, run functions for free
* Deep embedding
    * Represent elements by how they are constructed
    * Most of the work done by the run functions, constructor functions and combinators for free
* Or something in-between

---

## Shallow embedding of Signals

[Look at Shallow.hs](src/Signal/Shallow.hs)

---

## Deep embedding of Signals

[Look at Deep.hs](src/Signal/Deep.hs)

---

## Deep versus Shallow

* A shallow embedding (when it works out) is often more elegant
    * When there is an obvious semantics, shallow embeddings usually work out nicely (like in the Signal example)
    * working out the type might be very difficult (so a deep embedding may give you an easier start)

* A deep embedding is easier to extend
    * adding new operations
    * adding new run functions (more on this is another lecture)
    * adding optimizations

Most of the time you end up with a mix of both.

---

## Case Study: A language for Shapes, v1

```Haskell
type Shape
-- Constructor functions
disc        :: Point -> Radius -> Shape
rectangle   :: Point -> Point  -> Shape
-- Combinators
translate   :: Vec ->    Shape -> Shape
scale       :: Vec ->    Shape -> Shape
rotate      :: Angle ->  Shape -> Shape
union       :: Shape ->  Shape -> Shape
intersect   :: Shape ->  Shape -> Shape
difference  :: Shape ->  Shape -> Shape
-- Run functions
inside      :: Point ->  Shape -> Bool
```

Think about primitive and derived operations
* can some be generalized?
* simplified?
* more compositional?

---

## A language for Shapes, v2

```Haskell
type Shape
-- Constructor functions
empty   :: Shape  -- useful "base case"
disc    :: Shape  -- unit disc,   use scale to change size
square  :: Shape  -- unit square, use translate to move it from the origin
-- Combinators
translate   :: Vec ->    Shape -> Shape
scale       :: Vec ->    Shape -> Shape
rotate      :: Angle ->  Shape -> Shape
union       :: Shape ->  Shape -> Shape
intersect   :: Shape ->  Shape -> Shape
difference  :: Shape ->  Shape -> Shape
-- Run functions
inside  :: Point -> Shape -> Bool
```

---

## More on the interfaces

* No obvious derived operations
* Sometimes introducing additional primitives makes the language nicer
* We need a language for working with matrices!

```Haskell
transform  :: Matrix -> Shape -> Shape  -- new primitive

scale      :: Vec -> Shape -> Shape     -- now derived
scale v = transform (matrix (vecX v) 0 0 (vecY v))

rotate     :: Angle -> Shape -> Shape   -- now derived
rotate a = transform (matrix    (cos a) (-sin a)  -- Some linear algebra
                                (sin a)  (cos a) )

invert     :: Shape -> Shape            -- new primitive

difference :: Shape -> Shape -> Shape   -- now derived
difference a b = a `intersect` invert b
```

---

## Side track: A matrix library

```Haskell
type Matrix
type Vector
type Point

-- Constructor functions
point       :: Double -> Double -> Point
vec         :: Double -> Double -> Vec
matrix      :: Double -> Double -> Double -> Double -> Matrix
-- Combinators
mulPt       :: Matrix -> Point -> Point
mulVec      :: Matrix -> Vec -> Vec
inv         :: Matrix -> Matrix
subtract    :: Point -> Vec -> Point
-- Run functions
ptX, ptY    :: Point -> Double
vecX, vecY  :: Vec -> Double
```

---

## Shallow embedding

* What are the observations we can make of a shape?

```Haskell
inside :: Point -> Shape -> Bool
```

* So let's go for

```Haskell
newtype Shape = Shape (Point -> Bool)

inside :: Point -> Shape -> Bool
inside p (Shape f) = f p
```

In general it's not this easy. In most cases you need to generalize the type of the run function a little to get a *compositional* shallow embedding.

---

## Shallow embedding, continued

* If we picked the right implementation the operations should now be easy to implement

```Haskell
empty   = Shape $ \p -> False
disc    = Shape $ \p -> ptX p ^ 2 + ptY p ^ 2 <= 1
square  = Shape $ \p -> abs (ptX p) <= 1 && abs (ptY p) <= 1

-- Trick: move the point p instead of the shape a
transform m a   = Shape $ \p -> mulPt (inv m) p   `inside` a
translate v a   = Shape $ \p -> subtract p v      `inside` a

union     a b   = Shape $ \p -> inside p a   ||   inside p b
intersect a b   = Shape $ \p -> inside p a   &&   inside p b
invert    a     = Shape $ \p -> not (inside p a)
```

---

## Deep embedding

* Representation is easy, just make a datatype of the primitive operations.
* Deep ~= syntax tree ~= expression type

```Haskell
data Shape where -- using Gen. Alg. DataType syntax
  -- Constructor functions
  Empty     :: Shape
  Disc      :: Shape
  Square    :: Shape
  -- Combinators
  Translate :: Vec ->    Shape -> Shape
  Transform :: Matrix -> Shape -> Shape
  Union     :: Shape ->  Shape -> Shape
  Intersect :: Shape ->  Shape -> Shape
  Invert    :: Shape ->  Shape

empty = Empty; disc = Disc; ...
```

---

## Deep embedding, without GADT for reference

```Haskell
data Shape  =   Empty | Disc | Square
            |   Translate Vec Shape
            |   Transform Matrix Shape
            |   Union Shape Shape | Intersect Shape Shape
            |   Invert Shape

empty     = Empty
disc      = Disc
translate = Translate
transform = Transform
union     = Union
intersect = Intersect
invert    = Invert
```

---

## Deep embedding, cont.

* All the work happens in the run function (the interpreter)

```Haskell
inside :: Point -> Shape  -> Bool
p `inside` Empty           = False
p `inside` Disc            = ptX p ^ 2 + ptY p ^ 2    <= 1
p `inside` Square          = abs (ptX p) <= 1 && abs (ptY p) <= 1
p `inside` Translate v a   = subtract p v `inside` a
p `inside` Transform m a   = mulPt (inv m) p `inside` a
p `inside` Union a b       = inside p a  ||   inside p b
p `inside` Intersect a b   = inside p a && inside p b
p `inside` Invert a        = not (inside p a)
```

---

## Abstraction!

The module header can be the same for both the shallow and the deep embedding:

```Haskell
module Shape
	(  module Matrix   -- re-exporting the matrix library is nice
	,  Shape           -- hide the implementation, only export the type name
	,  empty, disc, square
	,  translate, transform, scale, rotate
	,  union, intersect, difference, invert
	,  inside
	)  where

import Matrix
```

---

## More interesting run function: render as ASCII-art

```Haskell
module Render where

import Shape

data Window = Window
    {  bottomLeft   :: Point
    ,  topRight     :: Point
    ,  resolution   :: (Int, Int)
    }

defaultWindow   :: Window
pixels          :: Window -> [ [ Point ] ]

render :: Window -> Shape -> String
render win a = unlines $ map (concatMap putPixel) (pixels win)
    where
        putPixel p  | p `inside` a  = "[]"
                    | otherwise     = "  "
```

---

## Connect back to to Signals

* Remember that the Signal type could handle any payload

```Haskell
type ButtonPress  = Signal Bool
type Curve        = Signal Double
type Animation    = Signal Shape
```

```Haskell
module Animate where

import Shape
import Render
import Signal

animate :: Window -> Time -> Time -> Signal Shape -> IO ()
```

Live demo.

---

## Summary

Useful functional building blocks: "functions from" and "functions to"

```Haskell
type Signal a = Time -> a
type Set e    = e -> Bool
```

* Different kinds of operations
    *  constructor functions, combinators, run functions
* Implementation styles
    * Shallow: representation given by the semantics
    * Deep: representation given by the syntax
* Remember
    * Compositionality
    * Abstraction

---

## Extra slide: Discussion

* Adding coloured shapes
    * Go back and discuss what changes would need to be made (open-ended)
* Bad shallow implementations
    * Looking at the renderer we might decide to try
        newtype Shape = Shape (Window -> String)
    * Discuss the problems with this implementation
* Other questions or comments?
