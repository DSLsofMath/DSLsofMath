Exercises for W5
================

1. Complete the instance declarations for `FunExp` (for `Num`,
   `Fractional`, and `Floating`).

2. Complete the instance declarations for `(Double, Double)`, deriving
   them from the homomorphism requirement for `apply` (from the end of
   the week 4 lecture notes).

3. We now have three different ways of computing the derivative of a
   function such as `f x = sin x + exp (exp x)` at a given point, say
   `x = pi`.

   a.  Find `e :: FunExp` such that `eval e = f` and use `eval'`.

   b.  Find an expression of (the first version of) type `FD Double`
       and use `apply`.

   c.  Apply `f` directly to the appropriate `(x, x')` and use `snd`.

   Do you get the same result?

4. Fill in the gaps in lectures on polynomials and power series.  In
particular:

- give a derivation for the definition of `*` for polynomials (Lecture
  10)

- check that, with the definition of `x = [0, 1]` in Lecture 10 we
  really have

<  as = a0 + a1 * x + a2 * x^2 + ... + an * x^n

- implement `idx'`, `sinx'` and `cosx'` using `solve` (Lecture 11)

- complete the instance `Floating (PowerSeries a)` (Lecture 11).
