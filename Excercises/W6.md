Exercises for W6 (closely related to exam question)
========================

A *ring* is a set `A` together with two constants (or nullary
operations), `0` and `1`, one unary operation, `negate`, and two
binary operations, `+` and `*`, such that

i. `0` is the neutral element of `+`

```haskell
    ∀ x ∈ A      x + 0 = 0 + x = x
```

ii. `+` is associative

```haskell
    ∀ x, y, z ∈ A      x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z
```

iii. `negate` inverts elements with respect to addition

```haskell
    ∀ x ∈ A      x + negate x = negate x + x = 0
```

iv. `+` is commutative

```haskell
    ∀ x, y ∈ A      x + y = y + x
```

v. `1` is the unit of `*`

```haskell
    ∀ x ∈ A     x * 1 = 1 * x = x
```

vi. `*` is associative

```haskell
    ∀ x, y, z ∈ A      x * (y * z) = (x * y) * z
```

vii. `*` distributes over `+`

```haskell
    ∀ x, y, z ∈ A      x * (y + z)  =  (x * y) + (x * z)

    ∀ x, y, z ∈ A      (x + y) * z  =  (x * z) + (y * z)
```

Remarks:
   - i. and ii. say that `(A, 0, +)` is a monoid
   - i.--iii. say that `(A, 0, +, negate)` is a group
   - i---iv.  say that `(A, 0, +, negate)` is a commutative group
   - v. and vi. say that `(A, 1, *)` is a monoid

Exercises
---------

1.  Define a type class `Ring` that corresponds to the ring structure.

2.  Define a datatype for the language of ring expressions (including
    variables) and define a `Ring` instance for it.

3.  Find two other instances of the `Ring` class.

4.  Define a general evaluator for `Ring` expressions on the basis of
    a given assignment function.

5.  Specialise the evaluator to the two `Ring` instances defined at
    point 3.  Take three ring expressions, give the appropriate
    assignments and compute the results of evaluating, in each case,
    the three expressions.
