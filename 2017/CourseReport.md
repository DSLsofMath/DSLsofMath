# Course report for DSLsofMath [1] course instance 2017

Patrik Jansson

During the last 12 months I have spent ~280h on DSLsofMath. Some of
this may be counted as part of the DSLsofMath pedagogical project but
the vast majority (~250h) is preparation for, and teaching of, the
2017 instance of the course. I have worked with a great team:

* Cezar Ionescu: main course architect, gave 4 / 16 lectures,
* Daniel Schöpe + Frederik Hanghøj Iversen as teaching assistants.

Daniel is a PhD student and experienced TA and Frederik is a MSc
student and experience TA. Both were new to this course.

I have spent most of my time on updating the course material and
preparing for lectures and exercise sessions. My time distribution is
roughly as follows:

* Main teaching: 50%
    *  120h Course material updates and lecture planning
    *   20h Exercise classes and Haskell setup
* Admin and leadership: 20%
    *   37h Preparing course start and other admin
    *   10h Leading the team
    *   10h Advertising and presentations
* Examination: 20%
    *   22h Exam construction
    *   19h Exam correction and reporting
    *   12h Oral examination of assignments
* DSLsofMath: 10% (could be more - the border is not sharp)
    *   28h Ped project

## Background: email 2016-12-07: Teaching resources allocated (from Ana Bove)

The course DAT325 DIT982 DSL for math has been assigned the following
(maximum) teaching resources:

| Name                     | hours |
| ------------------------ | -----:|
| Patrik Jansson           |   225 |
| Cezar Ionescu            |    45 |
| Daniel Schoepe           |    65 |
| Fredrik Hanghjog Iversen |    65 |

The planning was made for ca 35 students.

## Student statistics:

* 43 registered (Fire)
* 41 passed the assignments (2 failed)
* 33 sat the exam: 19 pass (58%), 14 fail (42%)

## Reflections

Teaching the course was a learning experience for all involved. I
worked through all the material that Cezar produced last year and
presented most of it in lectures. I also wrote up most of it as
lecture notes (as part of the pedagogical project). Cezar prepared and
presented two new lectures on linear algebra (to fit the course plan
and student requests). Daniel and Frederik worked through the course
material and provided useful suggestions for improvements. And the
students produced many interesting assignment solutions and some also
provided useful updates to the course material.

The DSLsofMath lecture notes [2] are now 68 pages and cover 14 of the
16 lectures (some more polished, some less). I have used chalk and
black-board for all my lectures and I have taken pictures before
erasing to make sure everything is documented. I did most of the
conversion into LaTeX notes during the course and the plan is to
continue transforming raw notes and pictures to complete the lecture
notes during the year as part of the DSLsofMath pedagogical project.
We also plan to investigate the student results on related courses to
evaluate the success of the main aim: to prepare the students for
better results in later courses.

The mid-course evaluation meeting [3] gave some useful feedback that
could be immediately implemented (changing one of the exercise
classes, more explanation of assignment 1) and some ideas for longer
term updates. The oral examination of assignment 1 felt a bit rushed,
so we extended the time per group for the second assignment.

Content-wise we re-did the first few lectures to focus more on
functional programming and less on formal logic. We spread out the
material over more lectures (using the full 16 = 8 weeks * 2 per week)
and we replaced two guest lectures by new material on linear algebra.
This part was mentioned in the course plan already for the first
course instance in 2016 but the material was not ready until this
year.

The number of students went up but the pass rate went down a bit (from
72% to 58%). Part of this may be due to the "first-year" effect (when
the student group has a larger proportion of enthusiasts the results
are higher). In any case, my hypothesis is that more practice is
needed and I will try to get the students to work more on the
exercises next year. And I hope having the lecture notes available
early on will make it easier to study.
