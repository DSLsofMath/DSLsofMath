   ~(+) = liftA2 (+)~ was not a good definition for ~(+)~

That approach uses "traditional" Nat-indexed matrices but the idea of this project is to do it with S-indexed matrices instead where

data S = Bin S S | Leaf

is a more detailed type of natural numbers indicating the "shape" of the splitting into blocks.

** DONE generators for specific matrix and vector dimension (untyped)
   CLOSED: [2015-10-30 Fri 15:06]
** TODO look at the possibility of a dimension-indexed datatype versions (Mat n a or similar)
** TODO get access to functional-feec and perhaps use some infrastructure (classes or types for Polynomials? Ring? Field? Vectorspace?)
** DONE Look at "power series, power serious"

** DONE Add a few more tests:
*** DONE for MatrixAlgebra1: associativity + unit laws for matrix mult
*** DONE for MatrixAlgebra1: associativity + commutativity for matrix add
*** Partly DONE for MatrixAlgebra1: some connections between matrix and vector
** DONE Experiment with larger matrices
** DONE From 4-tuples to data or newtype
