-- A numerical exploration: f and g are the same polynomial on real
-- numbers, but differ on floating-point. There is only one root (at
-- x=1) with multiplicity 6, but there are several million
-- zero-crossings near x=1 for g as shown below.
f x = (x-1)^6
g x = x^6 - 6*x^5 + 15*x^4 - 20*x^3 + 15*x^2 - 6*x + 1
